# RelayComputer
A simulation of a computer built completely from simulated relays.
I call it the 'J80' for no particular reason.

The code is C++ and designed to be built on a Linux system. It depends on
the presence of ncurses to provide a basic UI.

At this point the computer is basically operational, and can run simple
programs. There is a table-driven assembler that was downloaded from the
internet and configured for my processor.

Use the 'make' command to build the various elements and their test
harnesses as well as the final tester named 'ProcessorTest'.

Running the executable ProcessorTest will run the full CPU. It expects a
memory image to be provided in the file 'memory.img'.
